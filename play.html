       <p> <h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6> Well gentlemen? What's this? Are you going to
            show me your little skit?</p>
        <p><h6>DANCING MASTER:</h6>? What little skit?</p>
        <p><h6>ONSIEUR JOURDAIN: </h6>, the... What-do-you-call it? Your
            prologue or dialogue of songs and dances.</p>
        
        <p><h6>DANCING MASTER:</h6> Ha, ha!</p>
        <p><h6>MUSIC MASTER:</h6>You find us ready for you.</p>
        <p><h6>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>I kept you waiting a little, but it's because
            I'm having myself dressed today like the people of quality, and my
            tailor sent me some silk stockings that I thought I would never get
            on.</p>
            
       <p> <h6>MUSIC MASTER:</h6> here only to wait upon your leisure.</p>
